1. a. How many airplanes have listed speeds? 
Ans: There are 23 planes with listed speeds
Query: SELECT COUNT(*) AS "Planes with listed speed" FROM planes 
	WHERE speed IS NOT NULL;

1. b. What is the minimum listed speed and the maximum listed speed? 
Ans: The maximum speed is 432 & the minimum speed is 90
Query: SELECT MAX(speed) AS "The Max Speed listed of all of the planes" FROM planes;

Query: SELECT  MIN(speed) AS "The Min Speed listed of all of the planes" FROM planes;

2. a. What is the total distance flown by all of the planes in January 2013? 
Ans: The total distance flown by all of the planes in January 2013 is 27188805
Query: SELECT SUM(distance) AS "Total Distance flown by all planes for Jan 2013" FROM flights 
	WHERE (year = 2013 AND month = 1);

2. b. What is the total distance flown by all of the planes in January 2013 where the tailnum is missing?
Ans: The total distance flown by all of the planes in January 2013 where the tailnum is missing is Null.
Query: SELECT SUM(distance) AS "Total Distance flown by all planes for Jan 2013 without Tail Numbers" FROM flights 
	WHERE (year = 2013 AND month = 1 AND tailnum = NULL);

3. What is the total distance flown for all planes on July 5,2013 grouped by aircraft manufacturer? Write this
statement first using an INNER JOIN, then using a LEFT
OUTER JOIN. How do your results compare?
Ans: Airbus topped for the planes that flew the most distance on July 5, 2013. However, there are 127671 planes that did not have a manufacturer listed when using the Left Outer Join, a part from that the results were near identical.
