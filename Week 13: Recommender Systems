Week 13 Assignment: Recommender System
Company: Fashion Nova
Fashion Nova is a social-media-driven/marketed company geared toward selling affordable fashion via its online platform. Their goal is to attract their targeted demographic to purchase affordable high-end styles at an affordable price. Their targeted demographic comprises children & young adults. They have contracted several marketing techniques to achieve their goal, with the most impactful being employing Instagram models and influencers as brand ambassadors. 
Fashion is ever-changing, and for the company to remain relevant, the company needs to be able to pivot whenever there is a change in the fashion trends or the markets. As a result, it would be beneficial for the recommender system to perform scenario designs for the organization and the customers. By doing so, the company will be in a better position to predict if a trend will continue in the future and help the company adapt and make pivotal decisions. 
Every company should have a client-centric model, and this should most importantly be reflected through their website. The website features are a very standard online sales platform.

•	Login Page 
•	Wishlist

•	Whenever possible, they should be providing recommendations from their new arrivals based on style trends based on your purchase history or favorited items.
